      <template v-slot:lead>
        Our work focuses on three things: voting, education,
        and getting more women involved in politics. We are a grassroots team of
        Illinois women working to engage a new wave of voters, community members,
        activists, and politicians.

      <template v-slot:lead>
        She Votes Illinois was founded when a few women got together over coffee in 2017.
        We were disappointed that there were no women running for governor of
        Illinois—especially since Illinois has never had a woman serve as governor.

        More than 500 people attended our inaugural event, where we questioned and
         challenged the candidates on the record on a wide range of issues that
         included violence against women, equal pay for equal work, and access
         to choice in healthcare.
