# SheVotesIllinois

This is the git repository for She Votes Illinois project team of TechTeam at Institute of Politics. We aim to build a more impactful and accessible website for the statewide political action committee She Votes Illinois. In particular, we look forward to adding more dynamic components for the website, implementing a blogging section, enabling translation between Engliash and Spanish, and making donation easier.

We started this project in November 2019. So far we have constructed a basic prototype for the home page and a server that supports blogging functions.

We are using Vue.js on the frontend and flask on the backend. The frontend files can be found under the "shevotesillinois" directory, and the backend files are under "server".

To take a look of the current frontend on your local server, run "npm install" under shevotesillinois, and run "npm run serve". To run the backend, enter "run app.py" in the server directory.
